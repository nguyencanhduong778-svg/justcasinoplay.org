                <h1><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></h1>
<p>Welcome to Just Casino Canada! This Cookie Policy explains how<a href="https://justcasinoplay.org">https://justcasinoplay.org</a> ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
<h2><strong>What are cookies?</strong></h2>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Just Casino Canada) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
<h2><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></h2>
<p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. For example, Just Casino Canada uses cookies to remember your login status, understand how you interact with our site, and improve your navigation. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
<h2><strong>Specifically, the types of first and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential Website Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. For example, cookies related to "just casino login" or "just spin casino login" would fall into this category, ensuring you can access your account.</li>
<li><strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to its use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like remembering your preferences) may become unavailable. This helps with aspects like "just casino withdrawal time" by ensuring smooth processing.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you. This data can help us answer questions like "is just casino legit" by providing insights into user behavior and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. This helps us reach players searching for "just online casino" or "just play casino."</li>
<li><strong>Social Networking Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Website through third-party social networking and other websites.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How can I control cookies?</strong></h2>
<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table below.</p>
<p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website, though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may be restricted. As each browser is different, please refer to your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser controls:</strong> You can typically find these settings in the "options" or "preferences" menu of your browser.</li>
<li><strong>Opting out of targeted advertising:</strong> Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong></h2>
<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.</p>
<h2><strong>More information about our services:</strong></h2>
<p>For more details on how we ensure fairness and address common concerns like "is just casino legit in canada," please refer to our main terms and conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>How often will we update this Cookie Policy?</strong></h2>
<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please, therefore, re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>
<p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
<h2><strong>Where can I get further information?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at:<a href="mailto:privacy.justcasino@email.com">privacy.justcasino@email.com</a></p>
